                    instruction to meet his or her unique learning needs. Our unique approach of embedding therapeutic supports
                    throughout the academic school day allows us to provide students with an environment in which they feel safe to
                    learn, grow, and build positive relationships. Each student at Hope Academy receives individualized instruction
                    aligned with the Connecticut State Standards as well as targeted intervention using specialized methodologies when
                    appropriate. Emphasis is placed on college and career readiness, and the development of executive functioning
                    skills for all students.
